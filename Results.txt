Results on variouos processes and clases balance among the Datasets

CK+48 is the widest Dataset and at the same time the most unbalanced between the classes
it does not include neutral expresion, the number of samples included are:
	Surprise:	249
	Happy		207
	Anger		135
	Sad			84
	Neutral		0

Faces DB is a fully balanced Dataset, it contains the same number of samples for each individual
it includes more facial emotions and even side views for all the faces, it was originally created
for CGI
	Surprise:	36
	Happy		36
	Anger		36
	Sad			36
	Neutral		36

A private Dataset was also used, it was created with the contribution from friends and relatives
such Dataset is fully balanced among the classes
	Surprise:	38
	Happy		38
	Anger		38
	Sad			38
	Neutral		38

NOTE:
Neutral expresion is not considered an emotion in this context, is mainly used as a pivot,
so when the script is executed in real time, the person being evaluated can shift between the
emotions to predict

*****************************************************************************************
Results with original Datasets and non balanced classes:
(65, 'LogisticRegression', 0.863768115942029, 46)

First value means best random_state found for function train_test_split()
Second value means predictor used from sklearn
Third value means precision score obtained
Fourth value means best random_state found for the training (fit()) of the model

Surprise    323
Happy       281
Anger       209
Sad         158
Neutral      74

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Results with clases balanced according to the samples for the "Sad" expression
(76, 'LogisticRegression', 0.7424892703862661, 4)

Anger       158
Surprise    158
Sad         158
Happy       158
Neutral      74

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Results with the Datasets: Faces DB and the private Dataset, ignoring the CK+48 Dataset
to discard the unbalance, the inherent repetition in the samples and the absence of the
neutral expression in such Dataset
(98, 'LogisticRegression', 0.5121951219512195, 12)

Anger       74
Surprise    74
Happy       74
Neutral     74
Sad         74

Results with the complete balance of all the Datasets, it was done with the resample() function
of sklearn using random_state=42
(10, 'LogisticRegression', 0.9606003752345216, 60)

The precision increment is remarkable, overcoming 95%, however in this particular case a phenomenon
called Overfitting is present, it means that the model is memorizing the features from the Datasets
and it will be more difficult to correctly predict new samples that not belong to the original Datasets

In the present model, such Overfitting tends to the emotions from ck+48 Dataset, experimentally it
was found that the model did predict very efficiently the samples in CK+48, however when used to
predict fully alien individuals the precision rate lowered down, specifically between the "Sad" and
"Anger" emotions and the neutral expression, confusing them with each other.

Sad         323
Neutral     323
Anger       323
Surprise    323
Happy       323

CONCLUSIONS:
It is possible for a computer through Machine Learning algorithms to predict human beings
basic emotions

The importance of the quantity/quality relationship in all the data used to train the algorithm
is crucial and will determine teh effectiveness in each used mathematical model

The precision score obtained, will not always be the best indicator of a predictor's efficiency,
this is because as we see during the full classes balance it is possible to have an Overfitting that
will affect the real perfomance of the model

NOTE:
Two mathematical models are included in .sav format
modelo_Reco_Facial_LogReg.sav, this model is based on the first results shown
from the non balanced classes with the score = 0.863768 and,
modelo_Reco_Facial_LogReg_Over.sav this model is based on the results shown
from the fully balanced classes with the score = 0.960600
to switch between them it is just needed to change the comment line
